## Info
We chose to do nr. 3 in the assignment.  
The program is used to send an Email to all of the people that is saved in the `people.json` file
The middleware sends a request to a name api to get the gender of each client and then injects that gender and name into a message that is created from the content of `Template email.txt` and then send that email to all the clients as a message.
