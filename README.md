## Info
We chose to do nr. 3 in the assignment.  
The program is used to send an Email to all of the people that is saved in the `people.json` file.  
The middleware sends the name of each person in the json file is to a naming-api to determine the title of the person.  
When the title is retrieved, it then injects the title and name into a message that is generated from the content of `TemplateEmail.txt`.
Each message created will then be sent to the respectable person as a message.
